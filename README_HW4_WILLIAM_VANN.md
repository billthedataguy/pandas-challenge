# Two Observable Trends Based on the Data

1. In aggregate, ***Charter schools have much higher percent passing rates*** than District schools. This is interesting in itself, but particularly so because Charter school average math and reading scores are not significantly higher than District school average math and reading scores. The ***% Overall Passing feature*** is the most stark contrast, with over 90% of Charter school students passing and under 54% of District school students passing.   

2. ***Large size schools (2000-5000 students) fared far worse in scores and passing percentages*** than medium or small size schools. Again ***% Overall Passing*** displays the starkest contrast, with small and medium size schools achieving around 90% while large size schools achieving just above 58%.
